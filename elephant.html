            <ol>
                <li>Start with your paper white side up, if it has one. Fold the paper in half, from left to right and then bottom to top. </li>
                <li>fold the top and bottom edge to the horizontal central crease and unfold.</li>
                <li>Fold the left and right edges to the vertical central crease and unfold.</li>
                <li>You now have a neat grid of 15 equal sections.</li>
                <li>Rotate the paper so that it is a diamond.</li>
                <li>Fold the top, bottom and left corner to the central crease–not the right corner</li>
                <li>Fold the bottom edge up to meet the top-most horizontal crease. Unfold.</li>
                <li>Repeat the last step, fold the top corner down to the lowest horizontal crease, and the right and left corners to their opposing creases.</li>
                <li>Fold the paper</li>
                <li>Repeat for the other diagonal crease.</li>
                <li>Flip the paper over, from top to bottom, keeping the right (uncreased) section on the right.</li>
                <li>Fold the left corner to the right, to the point indicated. For thick paper, avoid the middle diamond.</li>
                <li>Fold the corner back over to the left. </li>
                <li>Flip the paper over, from top to bottom.</li>
                <li>Fold the bottom right section diagonally up to the left, followed by the top right section.</li>
                <li>Fold the right section over to the left, squashing the diagonal folds you just made.</li>
                <li>Rotate the paper.
                <li>Now you can grab the bottom section and flip it under and behind. The top flap will come down to the bottom.</li>
                <li>Next, you'll fold the left and right corners of the lower section to the central crease.</li>
                <li>Flip the paper over to the other side.</li>
                <li>There is a TV-shaped crease on the top of the front-most flap–these creases need to be re-folded as valley creases.</li>
                <li>Flip the model over and rotate as shown.</li>
                <li>Fold the model in half, from top to bottom.</li>
                <li>Hold onto the elephant's trunk and the back of his head, push gently. A new crease will form.</li>
                <li>There should be a diamond shape on top of the elephant. Open out the bottom of the model and push on that diamond, flattening it.</li>
                <li>Pinch the diagonal edge that appears on the left.</li>
                <li>Fold the flap over to the right.</li>
                <li>There is already a crease here; fold it over and tuck it behind.</li>
                <li>Now you need to repeat these steps on the other side of the elephant.</li>
                <li>Find the back of the elephant and pinch it, keeping that diamond intact.</li>
                <li>Make a small, thin fold. </li>
                <li>Open the flap that was under the tail-end of the elephant.</li>
                <li>Hold it as shown.</li>
                <li>The left of the diamond shape needs to be folded into pleats over to the right.</li>
                <li>Fold the top corner over and underneath the elephant. It will secure his "legs."</li>
                <li>Now you can shape the trunk however you like. You can fold it to be pointing up or down. After deciding, make a crease and then inside reverse fold it. Your origami elephant is now complete. </li>
