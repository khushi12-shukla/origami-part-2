        <h2>Every Monday and Wednesday at 7:00 p.m.</h2>
        <h3>A sketch is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number 
            of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might 
            be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle.</h3>
