                <li>a square piece of paper in half diagonally.</li>
                <li>Fold it in half again.</li>
                <li>pull back the fold you just made and you will see it has a crease line.</li>
                <li>the top of the paper, bring the tip and and fold it to the middle tip.</li>
                <li>same on the bottom of the paper. Bringing the bottom tip to the middle tip.</li>
                <li>whole paper over and fold the tip of the paper half way down</li>
                <li>paper 90 degrees and fold the top tip down.</li>
                <li>fold the bottom of the paper over spreading the two inner pages out.</li>
                <li>Stand it up and add any more details if you want. For example, we added a small white circle to put onto the belly
                     and small white triangles to go on top of the ears.</li>
                <li>felt tip pen to add the eyes and nose, and there you have it, your very own Wolf! </li>
